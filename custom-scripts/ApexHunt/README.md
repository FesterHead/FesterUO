## System Overview

Apex Hunt is an automated hunting competition system for ServUO designed to bring excitement and activity to the wilderness:
1. **Dynamic Triggering**: When at least one player character is online and the 2-hour minimum cooldown between events has elapsed, the system performs a 2% chance roll to trigger an event, retrying with a randomized 45 to 75 minute variance between checks if the roll fails.
2. **Pre-Event Countdown**: Once triggered, global broadcast warnings notify online hunters at 10 minutes, 5 minutes, and 1 minute before the cull begins, providing preparation time.
3. **The Hunt**: The system randomly picks a target creature from a 4-tier roster (Swarm, Beast/Elemental, High Threat, Boss/Ancient), determines a randomized kill goal, and opens a floating HUD widget for all active players.
4. **Tie-Breaker Mechanic**: The first hunter to hit the target goal triggers a 60-second tie-breaker window, allowing other hunters a chance to challenge for 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place.
5. **Direct Rewards**: At the conclusion of the hunt, gold bounties (up to 25,000 gp) are deposited directly into winners' bank boxes, with automatic queueing for players who log off before the event concludes.
