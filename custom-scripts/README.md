# ServUO Custom Scripts Directory

This directory (`servuo/custom-scripts/`) contains custom gameplay scripts, systems, items, and UI gumps mounted into the ServUO container at `/server/Scripts/Custom/`.

---

## Architecture & Loading Mechanism

- **Automatic Recursive Compilation**: ServUO compiles scripts using an SDK-style project (`Scripts.csproj`). All C# (`*.cs`) source files in `/server/Scripts/Custom/` and all nested subdirectories are discovered and compiled dynamically upon server startup.
- **Namespace Decoupling**: In C#, file system paths do not dictate class namespaces. Scripts can use any standard ServUO namespace (`Server.Items`, `Server.Mobiles`, `Server.Gumps`, `Server.Custom`) regardless of folder location.
- **Hot Reloading / Restarts**: Custom script changes made on the host take effect upon restarting the container:
  ```bash
  docker compose restart servuo
  ```

## Developer Guidelines

1. **Avoid Duplicate Core Types**: Do not place copies of upstream core ServUO files into `custom-scripts/` unless you intend to introduce new distinct class names. Core modifications should be implemented as unified diffs in `servuo/patches/` to prevent `CS0101` / `CS0111` duplicate type compiler errors.
2. **Externalize Settings**: Hardcoded variables (capacities, cooldowns, plot coordinates) should be exposed via `servuo/Config/` and read via `Server.Config.Get()`.
3. **Directory Names**: Avoid creating subfolders named `bin` or `obj`, as the .NET SDK compiler treats those as reserved build artifact directories.
