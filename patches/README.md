# ServUO Core Engine Patches

This directory (`patches/`) contains modular, unified patch files (`*.patch`) applied during the Docker image build stage (`Dockerfile`) to customize the upstream ServUO codebase in a clean, reproducible manner.

---

## Build Architecture

During the container build stage:
1. Git fetches the exact upstream commit pinned by `ARG SERVUO_COMMIT` in `Dockerfile`.
2. All unified patches in this directory are applied sequentially:
   ```dockerfile
   git apply --verbose /tmp/patches/*.patch
   ```
3. The engine is compiled into the release binaries (`Ultima.dll`, `ServUO.exe`, `Scripts.dll`).

---

## Patch Management CLI (`manage-patches.sh`)

A helper script is provided in `manage-patches.sh` to maintain and test patches against the local `upstream/` mirror:

```bash
# Verify that all patches apply cleanly against upstream
./manage-patches.sh check

# Check upstream commit vs Dockerfile pinned commit
./manage-patches.sh status

# Export current git diff in upstream to a new patch file
./manage-patches.sh export <patch-name>

# Apply all patches locally to upstream for development/IDE inspection
./manage-patches.sh apply

# Revert upstream back to clean stock commit
./manage-patches.sh reset
```

## Workflow: Creating a New Patch

1. Ensure the upstream directory is clean:
   ```bash
   ./manage-patches.sh reset
   ```
2. Modify the desired file(s) in `upstream/`.
3. Export the unified diff to `patches/`:
   ```bash
   ./manage-patches.sh export <number>-<feature-name>
   ```
4. Reset upstream back to stock:
   ```bash
   ./manage-patches.sh reset
   ```
5. Test that all patches apply cleanly:
   ```bash
   ./manage-patches.sh check
   ```
6. Rebuild the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker compose build festeruo
   ```
